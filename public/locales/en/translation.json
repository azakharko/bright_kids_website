In the classes, you will be able to immerse yourself in the whirlpool of folk traditions and learn more about famous Ukrainians. Each lesson is based on four components of language competence: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Children will also do various creative projects. For those who are just starting to learn the language, and if it is early school age - we will learn letters and words on various topics, playing and singing.
