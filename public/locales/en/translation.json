			"subTitle": "Speed reading",
			"description": "Speed reading is a technique that aims to increase the reading speed of an individual without significantly sacrificing comprehension. The practice involves various strategies and methods to minimize subvocalization (pronouncing words in your HomePage), reduce eye movement, and increase the overall reading pace. <br/> <br/> Some common speed reading techniques include: <br/> Subvocalization Reduction: Minimizing or eliminating the habit of pronouncing each word mentally while reading. Peripheral Vision Expansion: Training the eyes to capture more words in each glance by widening the field of vision. <br/> <br/> Chunking: <br/> Grouping words together and reading them as a single unit rather than individual words. Previewing and Scanning: Quickly reviewing the content before reading to get an overview and identifying key information. <br/> <br/> At our classes there are a lot of fun games which not only increase speed of reading but also create friendly environment of peers.
